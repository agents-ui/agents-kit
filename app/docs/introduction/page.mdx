# Introduction

**agents-ui-kit** is an advanced extension of prompt-kit, providing specialized components and utilities for building sophisticated AI agent interfaces, multi-agent systems, and autonomous assistant applications.

## What is agents-ui-kit?

agents-ui-kit builds upon the excellent foundation of [prompt-kit](https://github.com/ibelick/prompt-kit) by adding:

- **Agent-specific Components**: Purpose-built UI components for AI agents, including agent cards, status indicators, capability displays, and more
- **Advanced State Management**: Built-in memory bank system for managing agent state, conversation history, and context
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Components designed to handle multiple agents working together
- **Enhanced Interactions**: Rich interaction patterns for agent control, task management, and real-time status updates
- **Developer Tools**: Utilities and hooks to accelerate AI interface development

## Built on Solid Foundations

Like prompt-kit, agents-ui-kit follows the same design principles as shadcn/ui:
- **Copy & Paste**: Components are designed to be copied directly into your project
- **Customizable**: Full control over styling and behavior
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## Key Features

- ðŸ¤– **Agent Components**: Specialized components for agent interfaces
- ðŸ§  **Memory Bank**: Advanced state management for AI conversations
- ðŸŽ¨ **Themeable**: Full dark mode support with customizable themes
- ðŸ“± **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- ðŸ”§ **Developer Friendly**: Easy to integrate and extend
- ðŸš€ **Performance Focused**: Optimized for real-time AI interactions

## When to Use agents-ui-kit

Use agents-ui-kit when you need:
- To build interfaces for AI agents or assistants
- Advanced state management for conversations
- Multi-agent coordination interfaces
- Real-time status and progress indicators
- Professional AI application interfaces

This project extends prompt-kit with agent-specific functionality. We recommend using both libraries together for the best experience.

agents-ui-kit is open source. Check out the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/agents-ui/agents-kit).
